Walking on uneven terrain becomes more difficult as we age, and gait becomes less automatic. Using mobile brain imaging via high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide insight into the neural mechanisms contributing to reduced mobility capability with aging. The objective of this study was to quantify age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking, both averaged across many strides and variations within a stride. We included 31 young adults and 71 older adults for analysis. All participants walked on an uneven terrain treadmill with four levels of terrain difficulty at their self-selected speed. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited a greater increase in step duration variability and mediolateral sacral excursion variability as the terrain became more uneven. We identified multiple brain regions involved during walking on uneven terrain. Regardless of age group, walking on uneven terrain compared to flat terrain led to a widespread change of electrocortical dynamics in the brain, especially in the alpha (8–13Hz) and beta (13–30Hz) band power. In the parieto-occipital region, younger adults experienced a greater reduction in alpha and beta power with increasing terrain unevenness compared to older adults. We also assessed how intra-stride power fluctuations changed with terrain unevenness and age group. Greater intra-stride power spectral fluctuations in the occipital area were associated with greater terrain unevenness for younger adults, but not for older adults. In summary, older adults showed a greater increase in gait variability than younger adults as the terrain became more uneven, but exhibited a lack of modulation of parieto-occipital activity in response to terrain unevenness. The lack of task-related power modulation suggests reduced cortical network flexibility in older adults. These findings also suggest that older adults already heavily rely on visual processes during flat surface walking and may therefore have reduced occipital modulation range remaining to cope with the visuomotor processing demands of walking on uneven surfaces.
